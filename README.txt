Stock Volume Spike Detection & Unusual Trading Activity Analysis

🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes stock market trading volume and automatically identifies unusual volume spikes using statistical anomaly detection techniques.

Large volume spikes often indicate significant market events such as institutional buying, institutional selling, earnings announcements, news releases, or potential breakout opportunities.

The project downloads historical stock market data, analyzes volume trends, detects abnormal trading activity using Z-Score analysis, and visualizes the results through interactive charts.

🔍 Methodology

Step 1: Data Acquisition

Historical stock data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance.

Step 2: Volume Trend Calculation

A 20-Day Moving Average is calculated to establish normal trading volume behavior.

Step 3: Statistical Outlier Detection

The project uses Z-Score Analysis to identify abnormal trading volumes.

Step 4: Volume Spike Identification

Volume values significantly higher than the historical average are flagged as unusual activity.

Step 5: Visualization and Reporting

Results are displayed graphically and exported to CSV files.

📐 Z-Score Formula

Z-Score measures how far a value deviates from the average.

Z = (X − Mean) / Standard Deviation

Interpretation

Z-Score| Meaning
0 to 2| Normal Activity
> 2| Unusual Activity
> 3| Highly Unusual Activity
